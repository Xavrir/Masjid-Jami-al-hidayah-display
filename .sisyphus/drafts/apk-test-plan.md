# Draft: APK Feature Test Plan

## Requirements (confirmed)
- Produce a precise, step-by-step plan to test all app features on the APK and detect bugs.
- Include parallel task graph with dependencies, structured TODO list (category + skills per task), explicit success criteria, and test plan template.
- Planning only; no coding changes.
- Must include how to gather context (features list), how to run APK (emulator/device), how to record findings, and verification evidence requirements.
- Do not assume APK location or environment.
- Repo: /home/xavrir/Masjid-Jami-al-hidayah-display.

## Technical Decisions
- None yet (pending context from repo + user clarifications).

## Research Findings
- Pending explore/librarian agent results.

## Open Questions
- Where is the APK located (path or delivery method)?
- What environments are available for testing (Android Studio emulator, physical device, CI device farm)?
- What is the canonical feature list (existing docs, user-provided list, or in-app discovery)?
- Which Android versions/device profiles are in scope?
- What bug tracker or reporting format should be used?
- Any constraints on logs/screenshots/recordings (storage location, naming conventions)?
- Expected test depth (smoke vs full regression)?

## Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: APK feature-by-feature testing plan, evidence collection, bug recording workflow.
- EXCLUDE: Implementation changes, code edits, environment assumptions.
